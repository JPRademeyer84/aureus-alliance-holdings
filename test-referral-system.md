   - Complete the investment flow (don't need to actually pay)

#### **Expected Results:**
- ✅ Commission should be automatically calculated (15% of investment)
- ✅ Commission record should be created in database
- ✅ Referrer should receive notification about earned commission
- ✅ Commission status should be "pending"

### **Test Scenario 3: Admin Commission Management**

#### **Step 4: Test Admin Features**
1. Using admin account (TTTFOUNDER), access admin panel:
   - Use `/admin` command or admin login
   - Navigate to "💰 Commission Management"
   - View pending commissions
   - Approve or reject commissions

#### **Expected Results:**

2. View referral statistics and top referrers

#### **Expected Results:**
- ✅ Statistics should show correct numbers
- ✅ Top referrers list should include the test referrer
- ✅ Referral rate should be calculated correctly

## 🔍 **Database Verification Queries**

### **Check Referral Relationships:**
```sql
SELECT 
  u1.email as referred_user,
  u1.sponsor_telegram_username,
  u2.email as referrer_email,
  u1.created_at
FROM users u1
LEFT JOIN users u2 ON u1.sponsor_user_id = u2.id
WHERE u1.sponsor_user_id IS NOT NULL;
```

### **Check Commission Records:**
```sql
SELECT 
  c.*,
  referrer.email as referrer_email,
  referred.email as referred_email
FROM commissions c
JOIN users referrer ON c.referrer_id = referrer.id
JOIN users referred ON c.referred_user_id = referred.id
ORDER BY c.date_earned DESC;
```

### **Check User Statistics:**
```sql
SELECT 
  email,
  total_referrals,
  total_commission_earned,
  sponsor_telegram_username
FROM users
WHERE total_referrals > 0 OR sponsor_user_id IS NOT NULL;
```

## 🚨 **Common Issues to Test**

1. **Invalid Referrer Username:**
   - Enter non-existent username
   - Should show error and allow retry

2. **Self-Referral Prevention:**
   - Try to refer yourself
   - Should be prevented (if implemented)

3. **Duplicate Referral:**
   - Try to change referrer after registration
   - Should be prevented (referral is permanent)

4. **Commission Edge Cases:**
   - Zero amount investment
   - Very large investment amounts
   - Multiple investments from same referred user

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

- **Real-time gold price integration** (~$107,000/kg)
- **Operational cost modeling** (42-45% decreasing with scale)
- **Production timeline** from 250 hectares to 1,425 hectares

### 💰 Financial Projections
- **User-specific returns** based on share ownership
- **Quarterly dividend calculations**
- **Monthly income estimates**
- **Annual profit projections**
- **ROI calculations**

### 🎮 Interactive Interface
- **Phase selection** (1-25) for different production scenarios
- **Custom share amount** calculations
- **Production timeline** with key milestones
- **Real-time updates** and refresh capabilities

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Production Parameters

#### Current Operations (Phase 10)
- **Area:** 250 hectares
- **Washplants:** 10 units
- **Processing Rate:** 200 tons/hour per washplant
- **Operating Hours:** 10 hours/day
- **Operating Days:** 300 days/year
- **Gold Yield:** 1.6g per ton
- **Operational Costs:** 45%

#### Full Capacity (Phase 20)
- **Area:** 1,425 hectares (full concession)
- **Washplants:** 57 units
- **Processing Rate:** 200 tons/hour per washplant
- **Operating Hours:** 10 hours/day
- **Operating Days:** 330 days/year
- **Gold Yield:** 1.8g per ton (improved efficiency)
- **Operational Costs:** 42%
- **Target Production:** 15 tons gold/year

### Calculation Formula

```javascript
// Annual Material Processing
annualTons = washplants × tonsPerHour × hoursPerDay × daysPerYear

// Gold Production
annualGoldKg = annualTons × goldYieldPerTon

// Financial Calculations
grossRevenue = annualGoldKg × goldPricePerKg
operationalCosts = grossRevenue × operationalCostPercentage
netProfit = grossRevenue - operationalCosts

// User Returns
userSharePercentage = userShares / totalShares (1,400,000)
userNetProfit = netProfit × userSharePercentage
quarterlyDividend = userNetProfit / 4
```

## 📈 Production Scaling

### Phase Progression
- **Phase 1-5:** Early development and setup
- **Phase 6-10:** Current operations (250 hectares, 10 washplants)
- **Phase 11-15:** Major expansion phase
- **Phase 16-20:** Full capacity (1,425 hectares, 57 washplants)

### Linear Interpolation
The calculator uses linear interpolation between current and full capacity:
```javascript
progressToFull = (phase - 10) / 10
currentValue + (fullValue - currentValue) × progressToFull
```

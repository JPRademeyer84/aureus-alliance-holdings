## Backend TODOs

### üìä Data Calculation & Analytics

#### Affiliate Commission Calculations
**Priority:** MEDIUM ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**File:** `api/affiliate/downline.php:66-67`

```php
'thisMonthVolume' => 0, // TODO: Calculate this month's volume
'thisMonthCommissions' => 0 // TODO: Calculate this month's commissions
```

**Context:** Monthly statistics calculation is hardcoded to 0  
**Lines:** 66-67  
**Surrounding Code:**
```php
$stats = [
    'totalMembers' => count($members),
    'activeMembers' => count(array_filter($members, fn($m) => $m['status'] === 'active')),
    'totalVolume' => array_sum(array_column($members, 'totalInvested')),
    'totalCommissions' => array_sum(array_column($members, 'commissionGenerated')),
    'level1Count' => count(array_filter($members, fn($m) => $m['level'] == 1)),
    'level2Count' => count(array_filter($members, fn($m) => $m['level'] == 2)),
    'level3Count' => count(array_filter($members, fn($m) => $m['level'] == 3)),
    'thisMonthVolume' => 0, // TODO: Calculate this month's volume
    'thisMonthCommissions' => 0 // TODO: Calculate this month's commissions
];
```

**Note:** The actual calculation logic is implemented below these lines (lines 71-86), but the TODO comments remain

## Authentication & Security

### üîê Admin Authentication System

All admin-only endpoints in the coupons system currently bypass authentication for testing purposes. This represents a significant security vulnerability that needs immediate attention.

**Affected Endpoints:**
- GET `/api/coupons/index.php?action=admin_coupons`
- POST `/api/coupons/index.php` (create_coupon action)
- PUT `/api/coupons/index.php` (update coupon)
- DELETE `/api/coupons/index.php` (delete coupon)

**Required Implementation:**
1. Session-based admin authentication
2. Role-based access control
3. Admin user verification
4. Audit logging for admin actions

---

## API & Database

### üì° Missing API Endpoints

#### Leaderboard API
**File:** `src/components/GoldDiggersClub.tsx`  
**Missing Endpoint:** `/api/leaderboard/gold-diggers-club`  
**Purpose:** Fetch real-time leaderboard data for Gold Diggers Club competition

---

## User Interface & Features

### üñ•Ô∏è Incomplete Features

#### Profile Modal System
**Component:** DownlineManager  
**Feature:** Member profile viewing  
**Current State:** Shows toast notification  
**Required:** Modal or navigation to detailed profile view

#### Multi-Package Purchase Flow
**Component:** PackagesView  
**Feature:** Bulk package purchasing  
**Current State:** Shows alert dialog  
**Required:** Integration with wallet payment system

---

## Translation System

### üåê Translation Placeholders

The translation verification system includes TODO as a placeholder detection pattern:

**File:** `api/translations/verify-database-translation.php:153`
```php
$placeholders = ['TODO', 'TRANSLATE', 'PLACEHOLDER', 'XXX', 'TBD', 'FIXME', 'TEMP', 'TEST'];
```

This indicates that TODO comments in translation content are flagged as issues requiring attention.
